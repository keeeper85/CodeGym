/* 
Producerâ€“consumer

In the TransferObject class, arrange calls to the wait/notify/notifyAll methods to ensure the sequential production and consumption of objects.
In the run methods of the ConsumerTask and ProducerTask classes, create the necessary synchronized blocks.

Expected output:

... Put: M Got: M Put: N Got: N Put: K Got: K ...
where M, N, and K are numbers
The main method is not tested

P.S. Always try to use a concurrent collection rather than using the wait/notify/notifyAll methods manually.
Tasks like this help you better understand the basics of how multithreaded applications work.
